<h4> Resource Person </h4>
- Short course on *Concepts in Computation Acoustics* at Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad, India - 2021
- Faculty Development Programme on *Noise and Vibration Control of Structures: Engineering Applications* at Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University, Kakinada, India - 2018
- Faculty Development Programme on *Noise, Acoustics, Vibration Control and Measurement in various Engineering Applications with hands-on sessions* at Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University, Kakinada, India - 2018

<h4> Teaching Assistant </h4>
As a teaching assistant, I actively engaged in conducting lab sessions, evaluating assignments, and laboratory reports for undergraduate and postgraduate students at Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad through the following courses and laboratory sessions.
- Dynamics Lab (ME4435)
- Engineering Noise Control (ME5650)
- Design Engineering Core Lab II (ME5911)

<h4> Mentoring </h4>
<h5> During PhD at IIT Hyderabad </h5> 
Besides doing my PhD work, I was actively engaged in mentoring an external masters student for his thesis work. Our engagement received positive feedback and encouraging reviews, and the research work has been published in a journal in 2023. In addition, we developed a *Mid-frequency Range Impedance Tube*, an apparatus used to characterize acoustic materials according to ASTM E1050-19 standard. The product has been fabricated and tested successfully.

<h5> During Postdoc at IISc Bangalore </h5>
Alongside my postdoctoral work, I mentored four external undergraduate students, one masters student, and one project associate. Currently, I am mentoring one project associate on developing PINNs model for acoustic applications. I am happy to share that our research outcomes are published in two conference papers, and one journal paper. Currently, one journal manuscript is under review with the publisher and one more manuscript is under preparation.
